  """Runs response evaluation for agents."""

  @staticmethod
  def evaluate(
      raw_eval_dataset: list[list[dict[str, Any]]],
      evaluation_criteria: list[str],
      *,
      print_detailed_results: bool = False,
  ):
    r"""Returns the value of requested evaluation metrics.

    Args:
      raw_eval_dataset: The dataset that will be evaluated.
      evaluation_criteria: The evaluation criteria to be used. This method
        support two criteria, `response_evaluation_score` and
        `response_match_score`.
      print_detailed_results: Prints detailed results on the console. This is
        usually helpful during debugging.

    A note on evaluation_criteria:
      `response_match_score`: This metric compares the agents final natural
        language response with the expected final response, stored in the
        "reference" field in test/eval files. We use Rouge metric to compare the
        two responses.

        Value Range: [0, 1]. A score closer to 0 means poor similarity between
          response and reference. A score closer to 1 means strong similarity
          between response and reference.

      `response_evaluation_score`: Uses LLM to evalaute coherence of the
        response, including tool use. This is pointwise metric.

        Value range: [0, 5], where 0 means that the agent's response is not
        coherent, while 5 means it is . High values are good.
    A note on raw_eval_dataset:
      The dataset should be a list session, where each session is represented
      as a list of interaction that need evaluation. Each evaluation is
      represented as a dictionary that is expected to have values for the
      following keys:

        1) query
        2) response
        3) acutal_tool_use
        4) expected_tool_use
        5) reference

      Here is a sample eval_dataset value with one entry:
      [
        [
          {
            "query": "roll a die for me",
